# SelfLearna | Open CS Library

A high-performance, responsive digital library featuring 30+ essential Computer Science books. This project focuses on efficient data retrieval using advanced data structures.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Custom Properties & Flexbox/Grid)
* **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Data Structure:** Binary Search Tree (BST) for $O(\log n)$ search efficiency.

## 🧠 Why a Binary Search Tree?
Unlike standard arrays that use linear search $O(n)$, this library implements a **Binary Search Tree**. 
* **Efficiency:** Search time is reduced significantly as the library grows.
* **In-Order Traversal:** Books are automatically displayed in alphabetical order without needing extra sorting algorithms.



## 📂 Project Structure
* `index.html` - The structural backbone and UI layout.
* `style.css` - Modern dark-themed styling with full responsiveness.
* `script.js` - The BST implementation and UI logic.

## 📖 Featured Books
Includes 30+ verified free resources covering:
* Algorithms & Data Structures
* Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
* Systems Programming (Rust, C++, C)
* Networking & Operating Systems
